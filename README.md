# Differential_Reddening
This is the program I wrote to remove the effects of differential reddening (DR) from the main sequence of the colour magnitude diagram of the massive star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. 
This is not yet a completed program and it will be updated as soon as I solve the problems I face in removing the DR effects.
